<h6><code>Note 1:</code>

We observe beginners addressing bugs and creating feature updates without any assignment or prior approval from the maintainers. Even though we appreciate the enthusiasm, that is not how we are accepting contributions in our repository and we encourage all beginners to read and properly follow the [contribution policies](./CONTRIBUTING.md). Please ensure all ideas are thoroughly discussed and have received approval from the maintaining team before collaborators begin working on the updates.</h6>

<h6><code>Note 2:</code>

Once an issue is assigned to an individual (and one individual only at a time) we'll not reassign the same to anyone else unless the pull-request window expires (5 days from time of assignment) or the assignee unassign themselves. Any message from new-comers requesting assignment to an issue already claimed, will be ignored. First-time contributors are especially asked to take heed of this.</h6>

# üéâ What is [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com)?

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ijwmdoMc--/c_imagga_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_420,q_auto,w_1000/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/k8rdfvlf17di6gd9qyh6.jpg" />

Hacktoberfest 2023 is a month-long virtual festival celebrating open-source contributions. It's the perfect entry point for newcomers to the world of open source!

Throughout October 2023, all you need to do is contribute to any open-source project and merge at least four pull requests. Yes, you can choose any project and any type of contribution. You don't need to be an expert coder; it could be a bug fix, an improvement, or even a documentation update!

Hacktoberfest welcomes participants from all corners of our global community. Whether you're an experienced developer, a coding enthusiast just starting out, an event organizer, or a company of any size, you can help drive the growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-expanding community. People from diverse backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to take part.

Hacktoberfest is an inclusive event open to everyone in our global community!
Pull requests can be submitted to any GitHub or GitLab-hosted repository or project.
You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31, 2023.

## ü§î Why Should I Contribute?

Hacktoberfest has a straightforward goal: to promote open source and reward those who contribute to it.

However, it's not just about the T-shirts and stickers; it's about supporting and celebrating open source while giving back to the community. If you've never contributed to open source before, now is the perfect time to start. Hacktoberfest offers a wide range of contribution opportunities, including plenty suitable for beginners.

## üë®‚Äçüíª What Can I Contribute?

Hacktoberfest is inclusive and open to everyone, regardless of your background or skill level. Whether you're a seasoned developer, a student learning to code, an event host, or a company of any size, you can help foster the growth of open source and make meaningful contributions to a thriving community.

Contributions don't have to be limited to code; they can include documentation updates or fixing typos.

You can contribute to any open source project hosted on GitHub.com between October 1 and October 31, 2023. Look for issues labeled with "hacktoberfest" or "good-first-issue" on GitHub; these are typically beginner-friendly and easy to tackle.

## Do's and Don'ts of Hacktoberfest

<h4>Don't: open pull requests with minor text edits on other people's repositories</h4>
 If you're looking for a faster way to open four PR's and win, there's a better way!

<h4>Do: Follow a repository's contribution guidelines</h4>
 Almost every repo looking for help has a CONTRIBUTING.md file in it, read it first!

<h4>Don't: feel intimidated</h4>
